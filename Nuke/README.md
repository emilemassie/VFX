# NUKE TOOLS

This is a simple repository of tools and toolsets accumulated over the years.

Some of them I built myself and am very open to share it for better people to make it faster and more efficent.

## RotoLayerQC

After many talks and experiences in roto and paint QC and handoffs, I've developped this QC tool at Pixomondo.
This group node is sent to vendors and multiple departements around the world :) 

This tools is manly build to present edge QC and basic premult operation overlays.
It also presents a naming convention compatible to be extracted as depth / type / matte.

Thanks to the help of DasGrain and latest implementation of blinkscript voronoi pattern generation, we can crop a 2D part of the image
and Tile/Scatter it around. Why don't we have a tile+scatter (texturize) in nuke ???? I'm I missing something ?
