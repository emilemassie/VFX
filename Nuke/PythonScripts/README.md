# NUKE PYTHON UTILITIES

Feel free to grab this code and share it !!! 

These are all tools I coded myself. Most of it is to add additional functionality to pre-existing nodes.
All the fucntions are defined and not run in the code. 

If you are new to python, my sure to run add the code first and call the first definied function().
